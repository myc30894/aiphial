$deprecated = meanShift

===== long term =====

* write usable crossplatform buildfiles (mb Maven)

* do something with Native(CUDA) part. maybe port to Java/ScalaCL

* create "lazy" version of matrix

* rename matrix

* remove meanShift-project, reimplement its funtions with Matrix

* make Matrix compatible with DataStore

* create JSON-s with Gabor (and mb any others) filters

* unificate LUV and LUV point, make it scala and Matrix-compatible

* make matrix DLUVArray-compatible, or remove DLUVArray at all

==========================================================

Wiki plan:

- introduction (what lib contains)
- structure (what each subproject stands for)
-- third part libraries
- licensing
- building from source (there are no general-purpose build scripts yet except generated from netbeans. But manualy project building should not be a very complicated task if dont touch CUDA-part)
- samples (using command line-tool)
