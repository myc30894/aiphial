==========================================================

Wiki plan:

- introduction (what lib contains)
- structure (what each subproject stands for)
-- third part libraries
- licensing
- building from source (there are no general-purpose build scripts yet except generated from netbeans. But manualy project building should not be a very complicated task if dont touch CUDA-part)
- samples (using command line-tool)
