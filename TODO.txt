$unsupported = {GSMIPyRuner, meanShiftAppl, GMSPy}

$deprecated = $unsupported + meanShift

===== before publication =====

* rename GMS, GMSImages, GMSImagesExt, ScalaRunner packages to me.uits.aiphial

* mark meanShift as deprecated and keep old packages names

* check what projects depends on HungarianMethod Library and push GPL3 license in header for others push LGPL. Dont put license headers in $deprecated

===== maybe after publication =====

* create executable console application to run samples

* test on Windows

* review Scalarunner project. maybe it better to replace it with sample scripts

===== after publication =====

* remove $unsupported from main branch but keep it in repository history

* add extended samples and some docs

===== long term =====

* write documentation

* remove GMSImagesExt dependancy on HungarianMethod Library and unite GMSImagesExt with GMSImages into mixed Java/Scala project under LGPL

* write usable crossplatform buildfiles

* do something with Native(CUDA) part. maybe port to Java/ScalaCL


==========================================================

Wiki plan:

- introduction (what lib contains)
- structure (what each subproject stands for)
-- third part libraries
- licensing
- building from source (there are no general-purpose build scripts yet except generated from netbeans. But manualy project building should not be a very complicated task if dont touch CUDA-part)
- samples (using command line-tool)
